    <h1>Build <code>[50 | 100 | 1,000]</code> Open Source Projects</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, this guide was created for the interns I met at SHPE conference,
      you've been given this link because I saw potential in you.
    </p>
    <p>Remember that you are indirectly competing with other candidates.</p>
    <p>
      On top of your well earned degree, these ChatGPT prompts will help you
      compete, fast track your coding abilities, improve your technical
      knowledge and communication skills, and impress the Engineering Hiring
      Managers you'll be talking.
    </p>
    <h2>Prompt 1</h2>
    <pre><code>You are a [type of company you're targeting] founder looking to hire a Senior [Front End | Back End | Full Stack] Software Engineer. List 50 names of open source projects you would like to see on a candidate's resume, and tells you the candidate is experienced in building large scalable codebases.
</code></pre>
    <h2>Prompt 2</h2>
    <pre><code>List [50 | 100 | 1,000] fictitious repository names that will showcase experience in building scalable efficient applications for [type of company you're targeting]
</code></pre>
    <h2>Prompt 3</h2>
    <pre><code>Expand on the [favorite fictitious repository name] repository. Description, goals and libraries used.
</code></pre>
    <h2>Prompt 4</h2>
    <pre><code>Generate a scalable file structure for [favorite fictitious repository name]
</code></pre>
    <h2>Prompt 5</h2>
    <pre><code>In [favorite fictitious repository name], generate a fictitious file in [choose a folder from the generated file structure above]
</code></pre>
    <h2>Repeat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Repeat prompt 5 until you have a minimal running application</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Repeat prompt 3 untill you have
          <code>[50 | 100 | 1,000]</code> repositories uploaded in Github
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Live Example:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Prompts tested using ChatGPT 3.5
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Keep the prompts in one chat</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create a new chat when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              From the code you generate, you find libraries, technologies,
              topics or logic that you would like to learn more, explore and
              deep dive
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any other topic that is outside of the goal of generating open
              source projects
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use an audio recording app to record yourself talking about the new
          library, technology, topic, or logic you just learned.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Listen to the recording, delete, and move on</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>This will help you when it's time to talk about your projects</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prioritize building as many projects as you can. Learning about a new
          library, technology, topic, or logic can be done when you have free
          time.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <h4>
      If you would like others to test your minimal running application, make
      sure to:
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Include a README.md file in your repository that lists all the
          installation steps of the required libraries/packages and versions
          needed to run your application.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Step by step guide to run your application</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Expected results</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
